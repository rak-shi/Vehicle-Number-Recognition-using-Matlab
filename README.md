# Vehicle-Number-Recognition-using-Matlab
This project is based on the Vehicle Number Plate Detection using Matlab Software.The programs are implemented in MATLAB. The algorithm is divided into following parts: 
Capture image,
Pre-processing,
Plate region extraction,
Segmentation of character in the extracted number plate,
Character recognition,
Result.
